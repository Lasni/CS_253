#
# Modify the valid_day() function to verify
# whether the string a user enters is a valid
# day. The valid_day() function takes as
# input a String, and returns either a valid
# Int or None. If the passed in String is
# not a valid day, return None.
# If it is a valid day, then return
# the day as an Int, not a String. Don't
# worry about months of different length.
# Assume a day is valid if it is a number
# between 1 and 31.
# Be careful, the input can be any string
# at all, you don't have any guarantees
# that the user will input a sensible
# day.
#
# Hint: The string function isdigit() might be helpful.

def valid_day(day):
    if day.isdigit():
        day = int(day)
        if 1 <= day <= 31:
            return day
    return None


print valid_day('0')
# => None
print valid_day('1')
# => 1
print valid_day('15')
# => 15
print valid_day('500')
# => None
